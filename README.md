# stellar

A forthcoming version of madlib.space, rewritten in JS (for expedience)

## Goals

- [ ] - Provide a public package listing - WIP version available at: [https://brekk.github.io/stellar/](https://brekk.github.io/stellar/)
- [ ] - Write a tool to consume the documentation repo (see [excavator](https://github.com/brekk/stellar/blob/main/tools/excavator.mjs) - currently it mainly works but incorrectly strips the newlines from code blocks)
- [ ] - Create a structured version of the documentation written for [mad-notes](https://github.com/brekk/mad-notes) - WIP version available at: [https://brekk.github.io/stellar/how-to/01-hello-mad-mad-world](https://brekk.github.io/stellar/how-to/01-hello-mad-mad-world)
- [ ] - Provide a public author listing / page
- [ ] - Eventually: replace all the JS stuff here with native Madlib
